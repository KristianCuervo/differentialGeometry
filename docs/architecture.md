# Using the differentialgeometry library for solving problems

## class Space

The Space class is initialised using a metric matrix G, and the associated variables of the space X.
'''python

'''

The Space created will then be used for any functions which takes place in this space. It stores the information regarding the metric, and the properties which arise from the metric; such as the christoffel symbols, and the coefficient functions.
